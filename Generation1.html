                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Color TV-Game is a series of five dedicated home video game consoles created by
                Nintendo that were released in Japan only. Nintendo sold three
                million units of the first four models: one million units of each of the first two models, Color TV-Game
                6 and 15; and half a million units of each of the next two models,
                Block Breaker and Racing 112. The Color TV-Game series has the highest sales figures of all the first
                generation of video game consoles. The systems can run on C batteries
                or an AC adapter. It is also the first console to be released by Nintendo.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coleco Telstar brand is a series of dedicated first-generation home video game
                consoles produced, released and marketed by Coleco from 1976 to 1978.
                Starting with Coleco Telstar Pong clone based video game console on General Instrument's AY-3-8500 chip
                in 1976, there were 14 consoles released in the Coleco Telstar
                series. About one million units of the first model called Coleco Telstar were sold.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large product lineup and the impending fading out of the Pong machines led Coleco
                to face near-bankruptcy in 1980.

            <h3 class="article"> Magnavox Odyssey </h3>
            <img class="article" src="Pictures/Consoles/magnavox.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. The hardware was
                designed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates,
                while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas
                the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown
                box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable
                of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on
                the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game
                played. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional
                visual elements for each game, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the
                knobs and buttons on the controller in accordance with the rules given for
                the game. The console cannot generate audio or track scores. The Odyssey console came packaged with
                dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games,
                while a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for a video game console was conceived by Baer in August 1966. Over the next
                three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven
                successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers
                before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the
                console through their dealerships, Magnavox sold 69,000 units its first calendar year and 350,000 by the
                time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the
                Odyssey series of dedicated consoles as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey 2. One of the 28 games made
                for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful
                1972 Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the Odyssey. Patents by Baer and the other developers
                for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as
                "the pioneering patent of the video game art", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20
                years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million. The release of the
                Odyssey marked the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles and was an early part of the
                rise of the commercial video game industry.

            <h3 class="article"> Home Pong </h3>
            <img class="article" src="Pictures/Consoles/homepong.png" alt="">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success of Pong, Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products. A new
                electronic technology, the large-scale integration (LSI) chip,
                had recently become available, which Bushnell believed would "allow pioneering in new" game concepts.
                Atari began working on the reduction of Pong from a large arcade printed
                circuit board (PCB) down to a small LSI chip for use in a home system. The initial development cost for
                a game on a single LSI chip was expensive, costing around $50,000
                (equivalent to $320,000 in 2020), but once the chip was developed, it became cheaper to mass-produce the
                game as well as more difficult to reverse-engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect
                to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the
                codename Darlene, named after an employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and
                prototype and based them on the same digital technology used in their
                arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during
                the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After
                the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a
                prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal
                containing over a hundred wires, which was eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn
                and Lee; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype
                was constructed. The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974, and was, at the time, the
                highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's vice-president of sales, approached toy and
                electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt the
                product was too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods
                department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the
                sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed the game with a representative, Tom Quinn,
                who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal.
                Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to
                pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong
                booth at the American Toy Fair (a trade fair) in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting
                orders due to high price of the unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While at the show, they met Quinn again, and, a few days later, set up a meeting with
                him to obtain a sales order. In order to gain approval from the
                Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn
                and Lipkin traveled to the Sears Tower and, despite a technical
                complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as
                the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could
                produce 75,000 units in time for the Christmas season; however, Quinn requested double the amount.
                Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000
                units, he agreed. Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by venture capitalist Don
                Valentine. Supervised by Jimm Tubb, the factory fulfilled the Sears
                order. The first units manufactured were branded with Sears' "Tele-Games" name. Atari later released a
                version under its own brand in 1976.

            <img class="article" src="Pictures/Consoles/tvtennis.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV Tennis Electrotennis (Japanese: テレビテニス,[1][2] Hepburn romanzination: Terebitenisu, meaning Television Tennis, commonly abbreviated 
                as TV Tennis or Electrotennis) is a dedicated first-generation home video game console that was released by Epoch Co. in cooperation with Magnavox on September 
                12, 1975 for 19,000 Japanese yen only in Japan. It was the first video game console ever released in Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It released several months before the release of Home Pong in North America. One unique feature of the TV Tennis Electrotennis is that the 
                console is connected wirelessly to a TV, functioning through an UHF antenna. Depending on the source, it sold about 10,000, 20,000 or 3 million units 
                in its lifetime, including about 5,000 units in the first year. The successor of the TV Tennis Electrotennis is the TV Game System 10 from 1977.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wireless broadcast functionality of the TV Tennis Electrotennis got Famicom Designer Masayuki Uemura to consider adding that capability to 
                the Famicom, though he ultimately did not pursue it to keep system costs low.

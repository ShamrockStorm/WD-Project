		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S (collectively, 
		the Xbox Series X/S) are home video game consoles developed by 
		Microsoft. They were both released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth 
		generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One family. 
		Along with Sony's PlayStation 5, also released in November 2020, the Xbox 
		Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game 
		consoles.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 
		2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett", and consisting of 
		high-end and lower-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" 
		respectively. Internally, Microsoft had been satisfied with the 
		two-console approach for the Xbox One, and planned a similar approach 
		for the fourth generation Xbox, with the target for the high-end model 
		to at least double the performance of the Xbox One X. The high-end model 
		was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett", 
		while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game 
		Awards later in December. In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the 
		lower-end model as the Xbox Series S.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox Series X has higher end hardware, and supports 
		higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with higher frame rates 
		and real-time ray tracing; it also has a high-speed solid-state drive to 
		reduce loading times. The less expensive Xbox Series S uses the same CPU, 
		but has a less powerful GPU, has less memory and internal storage, and 
		lacks an optical drive. Both consoles are backwards compatible with many 
		previous generation Xbox games, controllers, and accessories. As part of a 
		program Microsoft calls "Smart Delivery", many previous generation games 
		feature upgraded graphics on the Series X/S at no additional charge. The 
		consoles are also compatible with the gaming subscription service Xbox Game 
		Pass, as well as the cloud game-streaming platform Xbox Game Pass cloud 
		gaming.

	<h3 class = "article"> PlayStation 5 </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/PS5.png" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console 
		developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced in 2019 as the 
		successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020, 
		in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with 
		worldwide release following a week later. The PS5, along with Microsoft's 
		Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, released the same month, are part of 
		the ninth generation of video game consoles.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform was launched in two variants: a base model 
		with an Ultra HD Blu-rayâ€“compatible optical disc drive, and a Digital 
		Edition lacking this drive, serving as a lower-cost model for those who 
		prefer to buy games through digital download.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a 
		solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable 
		significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 
		4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated 
		ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections and the Tempest Engine 
		allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other features include 
		the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility 
		with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.

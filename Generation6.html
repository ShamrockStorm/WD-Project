	<h3 class = "article"> The Sega Dreamcast </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/Dreamcast.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dreamcast is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27,
		1998, in Japan, September 9, 1999, in North America, and October 14, 1999, 
		in Europe. It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles,
		preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's Xbox.
		The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's
		eighteen years in the console market.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn, 
		the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with "off-the-shelf" components, 
		including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Released in Japan to a 
		subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a 
		large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony 
		built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations 
		despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant 
		financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast 
		on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself 
		as a third-party publisher. In total, 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support, 
		reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains 
		many games considered innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, 
		Phantasy Star Online, and Shenmue, as well as high-quality ports from Sega's 
		NAOMI arcade system board. The Dreamcast was also the first console to 
		include a built-in modular modem for internet support and online play.

	<h3 class = "article"> PlayStation 2 </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/PS2.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console 
		developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released 
		in Japan on March 4, 2000, in North America on October 26, 2000, in Europe on
		November 24, 2000, and in Australia on November 30, 2000. It is the 
		successor to the original PlayStation, as well as the second 
		installment in the PlayStation console line-up. A sixth-generation 
		console, it competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube, 
		and Microsoft's original Xbox.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced in 1999, the PS2 offered backward-compatibility 
		for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as its games. The PS2 is 
		the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold over 155 million
		units worldwide.[14] Over 3,800 game titles have been released for the PS2, 
		with over 1.5 billion copies sold. Sony later manufactured several 
		smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as Slimline models in 2004.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, 
		the PS2 remained popular well into the seventh generation. It continued to be
		produced until 2013 when Sony finally announced that it had been discontinued 
		after over twelve years of productionâ€”one of the longest lifespans of a 
		video game console. Despite the announcement, new games for the console 
		continued to be produced until the end of 2013, including Final Fantasy XI: 
		Seekers of Adoulin for Japan, FIFA 14 for North America,[16] and Pro Evolution 
		Soccer 2014 for Europe. Repair services for the system in Japan ended on September 
		7, 2018.

	<h3 class = "article"> GameCube </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/GameCube.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo GameCube is a home video game console 
		released by Nintendo in Japan and North America in 2001 and in PAL territories 
		in 2002. The GameCube is Nintendo's entry in the sixth generation of video 
		game consoles and the successor to their previous console, the Nintendo 64.
		The GameCube competed with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical 
		discs as its primary storage medium. The discs are in a miniDVD-based format, 
		but the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs unlike 
		its competitors, and mainly focused on gaming instead. The console supports 
		limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband 
		or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable, 
		which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld 
		as a second screen and controller like a Wii U. This allowed players to 
		access features like the Tingle Tuner in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, 
		among others.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reception of the GameCube was generally positive. The console 
		was praised for its controller, extensive software library and high-quality 
		games, but was criticized for its exterior design and lack of features. 
		Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide before the console was 
		discontinued in 2007. Its successor, the Wii, was released in November 2006.

	<h3 class = "article"> XBox </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/XBox.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox is a home video game console and the first 
		installment in the Xbox series of video game consoles manufactured by 
		Microsoft. It was released as Microsoft's first foray into the gaming 
		console market on November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by 
		Australia, Europe and Japan in 2002. It is classified as a sixth-generation 
		console, competing with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameCube. It was 
		also the first major console produced by an American company since the 
		release of the Atari Jaguar in 1993.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The console was announced in March 2000. With the 
		release of the PlayStation 2, which featured the ability to playback CD-ROMs 
		and DVDs in addition to playing games, Microsoft became concerned that game 
		consoles would threaten the personal computer as an entertainment device for 
		living rooms. Whereas most games consoles to that point were built from 
		custom hardware components, the Xbox was built around standard personal 
		computer components, using variations of Microsoft Windows and DirectX as 
		its operating system to support games and media playback. The Xbox was technically 
		more powerful compared to its rivals, featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III 
		processor, a processor that could be found on a standard PC. The Xbox was 
		the first console to feature a built-in hard disk. The console also was 
		built with direct support for broadband connectivity to the Internet via an 
		integrated Ethernet port, and with the release of Xbox Live, a fee-based 
		online gaming service, a year after the console's launch, Microsoft gained 
		an early foothold in online gaming and made the Xbox a strong competitor in 
		the sixth generation of consoles. The popularity of blockbuster titles such 
		as Bungie's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming, 
		and in particular first-person shooters.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America, 
		selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001, aided by the popularity of 
		one of the system's launch titles, Halo: Combat Evolved, which sold a 
		million units by April 2002. The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 
		24 million units, including 16 million in North America; however, Microsoft 
		was unable to make a steady profit off of the console, which had a manufacturing 
		price far more expensive than its retail price, despite its popularity, 
		losing over $4 billion during its market life. The system outsold the 
		GameCube and the Sega Dreamcast, but was vastly outsold by the PlayStation 2, 
		which had sold over 100 million units by the system's discontinuation in 2005.
		It also underperformed outside of the Western market; particularly, it sold poorly in
		Japan due to its large console size and an overabundance of games 
		marketed towards American audiences instead of Japanese-developed 
		titles. Production of the system was discontinued in 2005. 
		The Xbox was the first in an ongoing brand of video game consoles 
		developed by Microsoft, with a successor, the Xbox 360, launching 
		in 2005, followed by the Xbox One in 2013 and the Xbox Series X and 
		Series S consoles in 2020.

	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/GBA.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Game Boy Advance (GBA) is a 32-bit handheld 
		game console developed, manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the 
		successor to the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, 
		in North America on June 11, 2001, in the PAL region on June 22, 2001, and 
		in mainland China as iQue Game Boy Advance on June 8, 2004. The GBA is 
		part of the sixth generation of video game consoles. The original model 
		does not have an illuminated screen; Nintendo addressed that with the 
		release of a redesigned model with a frontlit screen, the Game Boy Advance 
		SP, in 2003. A newer revision of the redesign was released in 2005, with a 
		backlit screen. Around the same time, the final redesign, the Game Boy 
		Micro, was released.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of June 30, 2010, 81.51 million units of the 
		Game Boy Advance series have been sold worldwide. Its successor, 
		the Nintendo DS, was released in November 2004[10] and is backward 
		compatible with Game Boy Advance software.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the previous Game Boy models, 
		which have the "portrait" form factor of the original Game Boy 
		(designed by Gunpei Yokoi), the Game Boy Advance was designed in a 
		"landscape" form factor, putting the buttons to the sides of the 
		device instead of below the screen. The Game Boy Advance was 
		designed by the French designer GwÃ©naÃ«l Nicolas and his Tokyo-based 
		design studio Curiosity Inc.

	<h3 class = "article"> Steam </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/Steam.png" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. 
		It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way 
		for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to 
		include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an 
		online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers digital 
		rights management (DRM), server hosting, video streaming, and social 
		networking services. It also provides the user with installation and 
		automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists 
		and groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The software provides a freely available application 
		programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to 
		ntegrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including in-game 
		achievements, microtransactions, and support for user-created content 
		through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft 
		Windows operating systems, versions for macOS and Linux were later released. 
		Mobile apps were also released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone in the 
		2010s. The platform also offers a small selection of other content, 
		including design software, hardware, game soundtracks, anime, and films.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steam platform is the largest digital distribution platform 
		for PC gaming, holding around 75% of the market space in 2013. By 2017, 
		users purchasing games through Steam totaled roughly US$4.3 billion, 
		representing at least 18% of global PC game sales.[3] By 2019, the service 
		had over 34,000 games with over 95 million monthly active users. The success 
		of Steam has led to the development of a line of Steam Machine microconsoles, 
		which include the SteamOS operating system and Steam Controllers.

	<h3 class = "article"> Nintendo DS </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/DS.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo DS is a handheld game console produced by 
		Nintendo, released globally across 2004 and 2005. The DS, an initialism for 
		"Developers' System" or "Dual Screen", introduced distinctive new features 
		to handheld games: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one being 
		a touchscreen), a built-in microphone and support for wireless connectivity.
		Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game 
		Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS 
		consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short 
		range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. 
		Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo 
		Wi-Fi Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony's PlayStation 
		Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an 
		experimental "third pillar" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to 
		complement the Game Boy Advance (GBA) family and GameCube. However, backward 
		compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately 
		established it as the successor to the Game Boy series. On March 2, 2006, 
		Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of 
		the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens and a longer battery. On 
		November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi, another redesign with 
		several hardware improvements and new features, although it lost backwards 
		compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles and a few DS games that used the 
		GBA slot. On November 21, 2009, Nintendo released a larger verison of the 
		DSi, called the Nintendo DSi XL. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 
		154.02 million units, making it the best-selling Nintendo system, the 
		best-selling handheld game console to date, and the second best-selling 
		video game console of all time, overall, behind Sony's PlayStation 2. 
		The Nintendo DS line was succeeded by the Nintendo 3DS family in 2011, 
		which maintains backward compatibility with nearly all Nintendo DS software 
		except for some software that requires the GBA slot for use.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development on the Nintendo DS began around mid-2002, 
		following an original idea from former Nintendo president Hiroshi 
		Yamauchi about a dual-screened console. On November 13, 2003, Nintendo 
		announced that it would be releasing a new game product in 2004. The 
		company did not provide many details, but stated it would not succeed 
		the Game Boy Advance or GameCube. On January 20, 2004, the console 
		was announced under the codename "Nintendo DS". Nintendo released 
		only a few details at that time, saying that the console would have two 
		separate, 3-inch TFT LCD display panels, separate processors, and up to 
		1 gigabit (128 Megabytes) of semiconductor memory. Current Nintendo 
		president at the time, Satoru Iwata, said, "We have developed Nintendo 
		DS based upon a completely different concept from existing game devices 
		in order to provide players with a unique entertainment experience for 
		the 21st century." He also expressed optimism that the DS would help 
		put Nintendo back at the forefront of innovation and move away from the 
		conservative image that has been described about the company in years past
		. In March 2004, a document containing most of the console's 
		technical specifications was leaked, also revealing its internal 
		development name, "Nitro". In May 2004, the console was shown in 
		prototype form at E3 2004, still under the name "Nintendo DS". On July 
		28, 2004, Nintendo revealed a new design that was described as "sleeker 
		and more elegant" than the one shown at E3 and announced Nintendo DS as 
		the device's official name. Following lukewarm GameCube sales, Hiroshi 
		Yamauchi stressed the importance of its success to the company's future, 
		making a statement which can be translated from Japanese as, "If the DS 
		succeeds, we will rise to heaven, but if it fails we will sink to hell."

	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a handheld game console 
		developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released 
		in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in PAL 
		regions on September 1, 2005, and is the first handheld installment in the 
		PlayStation line of consoles. As a seventh generation console it competed 
		with the Nintendo DS.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003, 
		and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11, 2004. 
		The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced, 
		and was the first real competitor of Nintendo's handheld consoles after many 
		challengers, such as Nokia's N-Gage, had failed. The PSP's advanced graphics 
		capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device, which could 
		connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles, any computer with 
		USB interface, other PSP systems, and the Internet. The PSP also had a vast 
		array of multimedia features such as video playback, and so has been 
		considered a portable media player as well.[7][8] The PSP is the only 
		handheld console to use an optical disc format â€“ Universal Media Disc 
		(UMD) â€“ as its primary storage medium; both games and movies have been 
		released on the format.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSP was received positively by critics, and sold over 80 
		million units during its ten-year lifetime. Several models of the console 
		were released, before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita, 
		released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later. The Vita has backward 
		compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network 
		through the PlayStation Store, which became the main method of purchasing 
		PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31, 
		2016. Hardware shipments of the PSP ended worldwide in 2014; production of 
		UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016.

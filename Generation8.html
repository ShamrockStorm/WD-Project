	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo 3DS is a handheld game console produced by 
		Nintendo. It was announced in March 2010 and unveiled at E3 2010 as the 
		successor to the Nintendo DS. The system features backward compatibility 
		with older Nintendo DS video games. As an eighth-generation console, its 
		primary competitor was Sony's PlayStation Vita.
	</p>	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handheld's most prominent feature is its ability to 
		display stereoscopic 3D effects without the use of 3D glasses or 
		additional accessories, and offers new features such as the StreetPass and 
		SpotPass tag modes, powered by Nintendo Network; augmented reality using 
		its 3D cameras; and Virtual Console, which allows owners to download and play 
		games originally released on older video game systems. It is also 
		pre-loaded with various applications including an online distribution store 
		called Nintendo eShop; a social networking service called Miiverse (shut 
		down on November 8, 2017); an Internet Browser; the Netflix, Hulu 
		Plus, and YouTube streaming video services; Nintendo Video; a messaging 
		application called Swapnote (known as Nintendo Letter Box in Europe and 
		Australia); and Mii Maker.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan on February 26, 
		2011, and worldwide beginning in March 2011. Less than six months later on 
		July 28, 2011, Nintendo announced a significant price reduction from US$249 
		to US$169 amid disappointing launch sales. The company offered ten free 
		Nintendo Entertainment System games and ten free Game Boy Advance games 
		from the Nintendo eShop to consumers who bought the system at the original 
		launch price. This strategy was considered a major success, and the console 
		went on to become one of Nintendo's most successful handheld consoles in the 
		first two years of its release. As of March 31, 2021, the Nintendo 3DS 
		family of systems combined have sold 75.94 million units, and games for the 
		systems have sold 386.48 million units as of March 31, 2021.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3DS received multiple redesigns over the course of its 
		life. The Nintendo 3DS XL, a larger model, was first released in Japan and 
		Europe in July 2012, featuring a 90% larger screen. An "entry-level" 
		version of the console, the Nintendo 2DS, with a fixed "slate" form 
		factor and lacking autostereoscopic (3D) functionality, was released in 
		Western markets in October 2013. The New Nintendo 3DS features a more 
		powerful CPU, a second analog stick called the C-Stick, additional buttons, 
		an improved camera, and other changes, and was first released in Japan in 
		October 2014.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3DS family was discontinued on September 16, 2020, 
		though the Nintendo eShop and Nintendo Network remain active in most 
		regions. While the 3DS stands as the lowest-selling Nintendo 
		handheld, largely due to major adoption of smart devices, it is still 
		regarded as a success, hosting several critically acclaimed games that 
		helped it stay competitive, and helping Nintendo stay relevant in the 
		industry despite the commercial underperformance of the Wii U.

	<h3 class = "article"> PlayStation Vita </h3>

	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation Vita (PS Vita or Vita) is a handheld 
		video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. 
		It was first released in Japan on December 17, 2011, and in North America,
		Europe, and other international territories beginning on February 22,
		2012. The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable, and 
		a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices; as part of the 
		eighth generation of video game consoles, it primarily competed with 
		the Nintendo 3DS.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original model of the handheld includes a 
		5-inch (130 mm) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, two 
		analog joysticks, and front and shoulder push-button input, and 
		supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and optional 3G. The Vita features a 
		quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore CPU and a quad-core SGX543MP GPU. 
		The PS Vita 2000 series, a revised version of the system, was 
		released across 2013 and 2014. It has all of the same features 
		with a slightly smaller size, extended battery life, and an LCD 
		screen instead of OLED. Sony released the PlayStation TV, 
		a short-lived, re-purposed version of the Vita that uses a television 
		screen like a home video game console, discontinued at the end of 2015.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vita's design was intended to meld the experience of 
		big-budget, dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming 
		trend of mobile gaming as seen on smart phones and tablets. However, in 
		the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and 
		its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A 
		concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the 
		West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, 
		helped keep the platform afloat. Though this led to less diversity in 
		its game library, it strengthened support in JRPGs, visual novels, and 
		Western-developed indie games. This built moderate sales in Japan and a 
		smaller yet passionate userbase in the West. Though Sony has not 
		released exact sales figures, late-lifespan sales estimates are around 
		15 to 16 million units. In the platform's later years, Sony promoted the 
		PlayStation Vita's ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming 
		products, such as Remote Play of PlayStation 4 games, similar to the Wii 
		U's function of Off-TV Play.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Vita hosted several acclaimed titles and built 
		a small but loyal and passionate fanbase, the system is regarded as a 
		commercial failure, with a lack of support from Sony and major third-party 
		developers along with competition from the significantly more successful 
		Nintendo 3DS and smart devices noted as major factors. Production of the 
		system and physical game cards in the West ended in March 2019, with Sony 
		having no plans for a successor.

	<h3 class = "article"> Nintendo Wii U</h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/WiiU.png" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wii U (/ˌwiː ˈjuː/ WEE YOO) is a home video game console 
		developed by Nintendo as the successor to the Wii. Released in late 2012,
		 it is the first eighth-generation video game console and competed with 
		 Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics. 
		The system's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an 
		embedded touchscreen, directional buttons, analog sticks, and action 
		buttons. The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display 
		or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad. The Wii U Pro 
		Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative. 
		The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories. 
		Games can support any combination of the GamePad, Wii Remote, Nunchuk, 
		Balance Board, or Nintendo's Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller. 
		Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and 
		Miiverse, an integrated social networking service which allowed users to 
		share content in game-specific communities.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to the Wii U was mixed. It was praised for its 
		innovative GamePad controller, improvements to online functionality over 
		the Wii, backwards compatibility with Wii software and peripherals, and 
		price; however, it was criticized for its user interface and functionality, 
		and the GamePad's short battery life. It had low sales, primarily 
		credited to a weak lineup of launch games, limited third-party 
		support, and poor marketing including the lack of distinguishing the 
		unique functionality of the GamePad from just being a tablet device. Wii 
		U production ended in January 2017. On March 3, 2017, Nintendo released 
		its successor, the Nintendo Switch, which retained and refined concepts 
		introduced with the Wii U.

	<h3 class = "article"> PlayStation 4</h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/PS4.png" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console 
		developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Announced as the successor to 
		the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, 
		in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and 
		Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth 
		generation, it competes with Microsoft's Xbox One, Nintendo's Wii U and 
		the Switch.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture 
		of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit 
		(APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 
		1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU it had 
		developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social 
		interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the 
		ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported 
		devices ("Remote Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to 
		friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely ("Share Play"). The 
		console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 
		3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among 
		other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and 
		playback of 4K resolution multimedia.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with 
		critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing 
		independent game development, and for not imposing the restrictive digital 
		rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for 
		the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also 
		praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its 
		competitors; developers described the performance difference between the 
		console and Xbox One as "significant" and "obvious." Heightened demand 
		also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the 
		second best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, 
		a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the 
		PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock 
		rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its successor, the PlayStation 5, was released in November 
		2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the 
		Slim version in January 2021, while PS4 Standard and Pro versions are still 
		being produced in western markets following their statement of 3-year 
		support of PS4.

	<h3 class = "article"> XBox One </h3>
	<img class = "article" src = "Pictures/Consoles/XBoxOne.jpg" alt = "">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox One is a line of home video game consoles 
		developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to 
		Xbox 360 and the third base console in the Xbox series of video game 
		consoles. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, 
		Australia, and South America in November 2013 and in Japan, China, and 
		other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game 
		console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade 
		Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", 
		hence the name "Xbox One".[15][16] An eighth-generation console, it mainly 
		competed against Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and later the 
		Switch.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based 
		architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used 
		in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) 
		built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One's controller was 
		redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad, and triggers 
		capable of delivering directional haptic feedback. The console places an 
		increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking features 
		and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay 
		or livestream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games 
		can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 
		10 devices. The console can play Blu-ray Disc, and overlay live television 
		programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital 
		terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally 
		included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing 
		improved motion tracking and voice recognition.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xbox One received positive reviews for its refined 
		controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter 
		and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its 
		predecessor at launch, but the console was generally criticized for running 
		games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its 
		original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes 
		made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received 
		a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved 
		motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice 
		commands.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the Xbox One 
		S in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for HDR10 
		high-dynamic-range video, as well as support for 4K video playback and 
		upscaling of games from 1080p to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, 
		its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power 
		supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port 
		were noted. A high-end model, named Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 
		2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications 
		and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. The system was succeeded 
		by the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which launched on November 10, 
		2020.

	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by 
		Nintendo and released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. The 
		console itself is a tablet that can either be docked for use as a home 
		console or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its 
		wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog 
		sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to 
		both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also 
		connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad 
		form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, 
		supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports 
		online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad 
		hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are 
		available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital 
		distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. A 
		handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, 
		was released on September 20, 2019.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. 
		Known in development by its codename NX, the concept of the Switch came 
		about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 
		2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and 
		market competition from mobile games. Nintendo's then-president Satoru 
		Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The 
		Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game 
		players through multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard 
		electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to 
		make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible 
		with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external 
		support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively 
		sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help 
		build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's first-party titles, 
		including many independent video game studios. While Nintendo initially 
		anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from 
		first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the 
		end of 2017.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an eighth-generation console, the Nintendo Switch 
		competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. Nearly three 
		million console units were shipped in its first month, exceeding Nintendo's 
		initial projection of two million and within a year of release achieved 
		over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of 
		the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling 
		home or hybrid console in both Japan and the United States. As of March 
		2021, the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite have sold more than 84 
		million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of 
		Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games—The Legend of Zelda: Breath 
		of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. 
		Ultimate, Pokémon Sword and Shield, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons—having 
		sold over twenty million units each.
